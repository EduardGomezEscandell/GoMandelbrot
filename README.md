## Mandelbrot set drawer in Go
This is a practise exercise to learn Go. It draws the mandelbrot set.

### The math
The [mandelbrot set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) is a mathematical object defined as all complex points `c`, such that:
- Starting with `z = 0`
- Repeteadly applying the transformation `f: z â†’ z*z + c`, the norm does not diverge to infinty.

It is known that if `|z| > 2`, then the value diverges, hence we can color the complex plane according to how many iterations it takes to reach `|z| = 2`. To be certain that a particular point does not diverge, we'd have to iterate at infinitum, hence an upper bound must be set. This upper bound controls the accuracy (higher is better) and computational expense (lower is cheaper).

In these images, lighter colors represent faster divergence times (i.e. fewest iterations before exiting the threshold), and pure black represents that the maximum number of iterations has been reached.

### Image format
The image is outputted as a [NetPBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm) image, you can convert them to png with:
```bash
pnmtopng mandelbrot.ppm > mandelbrot.png
```

### Work in progress
- Currently the biggest performance bottleneck is writing to disk. To fix this, it would be wise to use a more efficient file storage format.

### Results
Here are a few images generated by this project. Go to [examples](examples/README.md) to see more examples, and details about them.
